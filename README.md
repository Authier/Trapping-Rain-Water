# Trapping Rain Water

# https://authier.github.io/Trapping-Rain-Water/

The Trapping Rain Water project was created using React and is based on LeetCode's challenge 42. This website was designed to aid in the graphic representation of the problem. By clicking on the page, the user can create blocks and then flood the map or utilize the randomization option to produce random blocks. The most challenging part of this project was figuring out how to store the data for each block so that I would be able to use an algorithm and flood the land correctly. I had to completely redesign the grid system in order to appropriately update each block's status.
